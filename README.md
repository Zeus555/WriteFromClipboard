# ✍️ WriteFromClipboard  

WriteFromClipboard is a lightweight Windows desktop application that takes the text from your clipboard and types it out automatically as if a real person were typing.  

With the shortcut **Ctrl + Alt + V**, you can paste text into any field of forms or desktop applications — even in “closed” or legacy software where direct data access is restricted due to licensing or technical limitations.

## 🚀 Features  
- Type text from the clipboard into any active window.  
- Simulates human typing instead of just pasting.  
- Global hotkey: **Ctrl + Alt + V** for instant text input.  
- Works with most desktop apps and form fields.  
- Improves productivity in repetitive manual data entry tasks.  

---

## 📂 Repository Contents  
- `WriteFromClipboard.ahk` → The original AutoHotkey script (**built with AutoHotkey v1.1.37.02**).  
- `WriteFromClipboard.exe` → Precompiled Windows executable (ready to use, no dependencies required).  

---

## 🛠 Installation  
### Option 1: Use the executable  
1. Download **WriteFromClipboard.exe** from the [Releases](./releases) section.  
2. Run it on Windows (no installation required).  

### Option 2: Run the script  
1. Install [AutoHotkey v1.1.37.02](https://www.autohotkey.com/).  
2. Clone this repository or download the `WriteFromClipboard.ahk` file.  
3. Double-click the script to run it.  

---

## 📖 Usage  
1. Copy any text to your clipboard (`Ctrl + C`).  
2. Place your cursor in the target field or application.  
3. Press **Ctrl + Alt + V** → the text will be typed out automatically.  

💡 **Recommendation:**  
When using text editors or form fields that have **auto-completion** or **auto-spacing** features, it is recommended to disable them temporarily.  
These features can interfere with the simulated typing process, since the copied text usually already contains the correct spaces and formatting.  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations  
- Best suited for **short repetitive tasks**.  
- While it can handle larger inputs, for **extensive automation** other solutions may be more efficient.  
- Typing simulation speed depends on system performance.
